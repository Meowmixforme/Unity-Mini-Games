# Build 6 Games with Unity3D

This repository contains a collection of six beginner-friendly Unity3D game projects. Each project is organized as a separate Unity project folder, making it easy to open and explore individually.

## Included Games

- **Block Dodger**: Dodge falling blocks for as long as you can.
- **Ball Coin Collector**: Collect coins with a ball, avoid obstacles, and aim for a high score.
- **Cube Runner**: Navigate a cube through a series of obstacles and survive as long as possible.
- **Egg Catcher**: Catch falling eggs without letting any drop!
- **Maze Ball**: Guide a ball through a maze to reach the goal.
- **Dino Run**: Control a dinosaur and avoid obstacles, inspired by the classic endless runner.
