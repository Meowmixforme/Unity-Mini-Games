# Unity Mini Games

This repository contains a collection of small Unity3D game projects, each organized as its own standalone Unity project. These mini-games are ideal for learning, prototyping, or adapting into your own projects.

## Projects Included

- **Tank**: A simple 2D game demonstrating player movement, collision, scoring, and scene management.
- **Barry's Bouncing Balls**: (Project included in structure; description can be added based on gameplay).
- **Santa Run**: (Project included in structure; description can be added based on gameplay).

Each folder contains an independent Unity project with its own `Assets` and `ProjectSettings` directories.

## Example: Tank Project

The `Tank` game demonstrates:
- 2D movement using `Rigidbody2D`
- Sprite flipping based on movement direction
- Score tracking with the UI
- Object destruction via input or collision
- Scene restarting on win condition
